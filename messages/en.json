That's why I decided to attend ZSTI, a technical high school located in Gliwice, renowned for its high-level IT education. It was during my time at the school when I truly fell in love with programming, specifically web development. I studied thoroughly and worked on my skillset to the point where I could take on freelance projects. As a full-stack developer, my job is to oversee both the front-end and the back-end. I connect the two branches together in a synergistic manner, creating a fully functioning project for the client. I use a wide range of technologies that allow me to elevate my work and give the customer the best possible experience. In addition to programming, I am also proficient in computer graphics, utilizing software such as Adobe Photoshop or Adobe Illustrator to create and edit images. Besides my technical skills, I pride myself on the ability to learn quickly and adapt to various situations. I am always open to learning new technologies, frameworks, or libraries. I also excel at problem-solving; I often look for creative ways to avoid or fix issues that might interfere with my work.
